.. admonition:: Start your assignment

    **You can start working on your copy of Assignment 2 by** `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/HmOpN5gk>`__.


- **Note that code versioning is important and contributes to your overall grade. We expect to see your versioning history, including commits and pushes to the GitHub repository. Remember, having only one commit may result in a deduction in your marks, so make sure to maintain a clear and organized versioning record.**
- **You don't have to submitt anything on D2L. Just push everything on the provided GitHub repository and that'a all!**



.. admonition:: Use of AI-based tools

    Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools using large language models (AI-LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, or DeepL, are changing the ways in which people produce content including software. 
    These tools are helpful for assistance and troubleshooting, but relying on them to generate entire code might hinder your understanding of the material.
    
    Remember, the goal is not just to get the correct solution but to comprehend the process and logic behind it. 
    You can only achieve this by writing the code yourself. Your growth comes from the effort you put into understanding and solving problems on your own.

    **So please use the AI tools just for assistance and troubleshooting, not for generating the entire code.**
