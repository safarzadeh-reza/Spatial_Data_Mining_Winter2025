.. admonition:: Use of AI-based tools

    Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools using large language models (AI-LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, or DeepL, are changing the ways in which people produce content including software. 
    These tools are helpful for assistance and troubleshooting, but relying on them to generate entire code might hinder your understanding of the material.
    
    Remember, the goal is not just to get the correct solution but to comprehend the process and logic behind it. 
    You can only achieve this by writing the code yourself. Your growth comes from the effort you put into understanding and solving problems on your own.

    **So please use the AI tools just for assistance and troubleshooting, not for generating the entire code.**
